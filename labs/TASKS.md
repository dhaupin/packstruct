Last updated: 2026-10-24 (scaffold complete at 0.9.0, folded the crashtest#19/#20 rulings; push pending crashtest#18. The proposal arc: #17 filed, #19 receipts + leans confirmed, #20 release-atomicity ruling encoded in DEPLOY.md.)

- [ ] M2: conformance harness (packs a loader must pass/fail)
- [ ] M2: scenario-profile fixture for crashtest-host packs
- [ ] M3: language pack (poststruct vibe checks)

## 2026-11-03 - the pin guard goes family-wide (packstruct#69 back-port)

- `scripts/check-action-pins.cjs` (the "pins, never floats" guard) was a packstruct-only artifact (it landed on packstruct's `fix/sha-pin-actions`). It is now copied byte-identical into every sibling: `crashtest`, `eyestruct`, `freestruct`, `gistory`, `govstruct`, `monoforge`, `poststruct`, `prestruct` (packstruct already had it).
- Wired as `npm run lint:pins` inside each repo's publish gate (`check` / `gate` / `prepublishOnly`) and CI, and the guard's own battery (`check-action-pins.test.*`) rides `npm test`.
- Each repo's workflows were already SHA-pinned, so the guard is now mechanical here too. Receipt: `ACTION PINS: PASS (19 ref(s), all SHA-pinned)`, pin battery 8/8, full battery green.

### 2026-11-04 - session: the docs-lane consolidation (this repo now calls THE one lane)

The family carried four docs topologies - freestruct's `docs-lane.yml`, coreforge's forked `docs-build.yml`, govstruct's copy of that fork, and five inline hand-copies - and the two reusable lanes had already drifted (ruby 3.2 vs 3.4, pagefind `latest` scrape vs npm pin). Owner call: consolidate to ONE lane, `dhaupin/freestruct`'s `docs-lane.yml`, no drift.

- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - now a THIN caller of `dhaupin/freestruct/.github/workflows/docs-lane.yml@22bb7e9b2634d6cdd966963d9e25c7f892577276`. The runbook (Jekyll, the hardened pagefind scrape, the pinned freestruct post-build layer, the optional crashtest dogfood campaign, the Pages upload, the main-gated deploy) lives once in the lane; this file keeps only the trigger, permissions, concurrency, and this repo's input pins.
- No `package-lock.json` here (a library), so the lane's lock-aware install takes the `npm install` path (and the lane's setup-node cache is skipped, since it needs a lockfile). No `crashtest.config.js`: the dogfood leg stays off. ruby 3.4.
- **Receipts:** the caller parses; `uses:` resolves to the lane at the pinned SHA; no local `docs-build.yml` remains.
- **No version bump**; a workflow consolidation, not a released surface.


- **The pin guard now scans `action.yml` (2026-11-04 sweep).** The family pin guard (`scripts/check-action-pins.cjs`) scanned only `.github/workflows/`, so a floating `uses:` in a repo-root composite Action manifest went unseen. crashtest's `action.yml` (the gate other repos add) carried `actions/setup-node@v6` and `actions/upload-artifact@v6` plus a duplicated `default:` key; both are now pinned and the key is gone. The guard scans the manifest alongside the workflows, and its battery proves the new leg bites. Sweep finding; no version bump.
